# Game of Thrones


Hello, and thanks for checking out my first project! This has been an extremely rewarding journey, and I'm happy to share what I have learned so far. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'game_of_thrones'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install game_of_thrones

## Usage

Follow the prompts to be inspired by one of the greats himself. 

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
